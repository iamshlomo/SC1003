Nanyang Technological University's SC1003 Introduction to Computational Thinking and Programming module

This project was independently undertaken as a graded and required component of the module under the C Programming section. Therefore, the code is in C language.
This is also my very first ever coding project, therefore do understand that it is of amateur level.


The NTU Name Card Holder has a capacity of MAX (e.g., 5 for this program) name cards. You are
required to write a NTU Name Card Holder Management Program. The program uses an array of
MAX structures for the name card holder.
Each structure should hold:

nameCardID – It stores the name card identification number.

personName – It stores the name of the person in the name card.

companyName – It stores the name of the person’s company in the name card.


The nameCardID must be unique. Therefore, each NameCard structure will have a different
number of nameCardID when it is created. You may assume that the name of a person or
company is not more than 20 characters long. In the program, it should display a menu to
support the following functions:

NTU NAME CARD HOLDER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM:

1: listNameCards()

2: addNameCard()

3: removeNameCard()

4: getNameCard()

5: quit

The program should execute the functions (or options) of its menu. It will continue execution
until the user selects to quit from the program.

Feel free to refer to the attached PDF on the task instructions and sample cases!
